<p class="main-text">We can call VShoujo the attempt to break into the Japanese-dominated vtubers market by an US organization. Unlike Hololive and Nijisanji, they primarily use Twitch for live streaming and Youtube only for highlight clips. It was founded in 2020 with the goal to give the talents complete freedom, offering tech and legal support, social media and PR. <p>

<p class="main-text">Although VShojo isn’t the biggest VTuber group out there, the eight members have had a major influence on Twitch. Ironmouse is breaking all kinds of records on the platform, recently streaming for 30 days non-stop and getting over 170.000 subscribers. She’s currently the third most subbed-to streamer of all time, behind Ninja and Ludwig.</p>
