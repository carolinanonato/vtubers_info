## What are VTubers?

<p class="main-text">A VTuber, os in japanese (ブイチューバー, buichūbā), is a virtual YouTuber, an online entertainer who uses a avatar generated using computer graphics with real-time motion capture technology. They are not only in Youtube, though, but also streaming in all video sharing platforms such as Twitch, TikTok and Niconico.</p> 
<br>
<p class="main-text">The majority are still Japanese but the trend is taking over the world with thousands of Vtubers in different countries like England, United States, Spain and Italy. Some of them, like Gawr Gura, have more than 3 million subscribers.

## How did virtual YouTubing started?
 
<p class="main-text">Some say it all started in 2011, when Ami Yamato, a Japanese YouTuber used a 3D avatar in her daily vlogs. The video itself was not a huge success but a new trend was forming and with it a whole new industry was launched. However, the boom came five years later, with Kizuna Al, a Japanese virtual idol and is still considered to be the first oficial VTuber. Her videos are like all the others, with game playing, talks, Q&A and although the primary language is Japanese her fan community is always adding subtitles to multiple languages.  </p>
<br>
<p class="main-text">Nowadays, most of the popular VTubers are under a company and don’t run their show on their own. That’s where agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji come, offering now only tech and art support with their virtual models but a whole management production services.  </p>

## How do VTubers work? 
 
<p class="main-text">First they need an animated avatar. There are softwares like VRoid and Live2D that are made for creating anime-style characters. The best thing is that you don’t need to rig the art, because the tolls provide it with a set of pre-rigged models. The content creator just needs to sketch their character and overlay with a premade set. </p>
<br>
<p class="main-text">The next thing is motion capture. Usually it is a costly process, the one we see in movies like Avatar and Lord of the Rings and not home-based Youtube creators. The most common used by VTubers are services like CVPR, Siggraph and AWE, which use camera-based body tracking. That means that with a simple 2D webcam you can start the motion capture and real-time rendering. For streaming they usually use softwares like OBS Studio or Camtasia, both free to use. </p>

## Biggest Companies

<p class="main-text">The stronger agency on the market is Cover Corporation, operator of the network Hololive. The channels have more than 40 million subscribers combined on Youtube and 40 more millions on Bilibili. According to Wikipedia, the CEO Motoaki Tanigo was selected as one of Japan's Top 20 Entrepreneurs by Forbes Japan in its January 2022 issue.</p>
<br>
<p class="main-text">Nijisanji, managed by ANYCOLOR, often comes in second to Hololive and are their biggest rivals, with over 300 idols. They are the biggest-by-numbers and have the greatest triumph in starting to take hold in the English market.
