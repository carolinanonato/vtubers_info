<p class="main-text">Hololive Production (Japanese: ホロライブプロダクション) is a virtual YouTuber (VTuber) agency owned by Japanese tech entertainment company Cover Corporation. In addition to acting as a multi-channel network, Hololive Production also handles merchandising especially in music production and concert organization. As of 2022, the agency manages more than 60 VTubers between four branches, including several of the most subscribed-to VTubers on YouTube.<p>

<p class="main-text">The name "Hololive" was initially used for Cover's 3D stream distribution app, launched in December 2017, and later its female VTuber agency, whose first generation debuted from May to June 2018. In December 2019, Hololive was merged with Cover's male Holostars agency and INoNaKa music label under the unified "Hololive Production" brand.<p>
